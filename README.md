🟦 FrameTrace

Visual state monitoring & detection tool

by Stella Group ✨

“Stop staring at the screen. Let FrameTrace do it.”

👀 What is FrameTrace?

FrameTrace is a profile-based visual monitoring desktop app.

It watches a live video input (via OBS Virtual Camera), compares what it sees against user-defined visual references, and alerts you when a specific visual state appears.

It is:

🧠 deterministic (no mystery logic)

🧱 modular (layers matter)

🧹 safe with files (nothing important gets overwritten)

😴 boring to extend (this is a feature)

FrameTrace is not game-specific, not cloud-based, and not AI hype.
It’s a local, power-user tool for people who want control.
